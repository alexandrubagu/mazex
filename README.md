## Instalation

In order to generate mazes with `mazex` you need to have [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) installed.

After that you can clone this repository and compile the project by running `mix compile`

## Usage

Maze can be generated by using `mix mazex` task. The task accepts the following options:

```bash
## Options

    --rows             # Number of rows for the maze
    --columns          # Number of columns for the maze
    --algorithm        # One of the following algorithms: aldous_broder, binary_tree, kruskal, prim, recursive_backtracker, sidewinder, wilson
    --output           # Output folder if not given it will use the current folder as output folder
    --filename         # File name to be used for generated maze image, if not given it will use the maze_<current_timestamp>.png.
```

Example:

```bash
mix mazex --rows=10 --columns=15 --algorithm=binary_tree

mix mazex --rows=10 --columns=15 --algorithm=sidewinder --output=/tmp --filename=maze.png
```

## Algorithms

Supported maze algorithms:

#### Binary Tree

Binary Tree produces mazes by visiting each cell in a grid and carving a passage either south or east. This causes a bias toward paths which flow down and to the right.

#### Sidewinder

Sidewinder is based upon Binary Tree, but tries to group adjacent cells together before carving a passage
south from one of them.

#### Aldous Broder

Aldous-Broder picks a random cell in the grid and the does a random walk by choosing a random unvisited neighbor. The algorithm ends when all cells have been visited.

#### Wilson

Wilson's starts at a random cell and then does a random walk. When it introduces a loop by coming back to a visited cell, it erases the loop then continues the random walk from that point. The algorithm produces a completely unbiased maze.

#### Recursive Backtracker

Recursive Backtracker uses a random-walk algorithm. When it encounters a dead end, it backtracks to the last unvisited cell and resumes the random walk from that position. It completes when it backtracks to the starting cell.

#### Kruskal

Kruskal's algorithm is focused on generating a minimum spanning tree.

#### Prim

Prim's algorithm generates a minimum spanning tree by starting with a position and adding the cheapest edge available. Weights are assigned randomly to ensure a less biased maze.
